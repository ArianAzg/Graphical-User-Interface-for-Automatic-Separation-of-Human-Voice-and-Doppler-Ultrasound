# Graphical-User-Interface-for-Automatic-Separation-of-Human-Voice-and-Doppler-Ultrasound

In this repository, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to perform the automatic speech recognition and separation in audio Doppler recordings. In early 1970s and 1980s, audio Doppler recordings were captured in one-channel audio with the presence of human voice. The data remains undesired unless the human voice activity effectively gets separated from audio Doppler ultrasound. An example of of the dataset is shown in figure below:

The recognition task incorporates the Google speech recognizer to detect the presence of human voice together with corresponding timestamps. The detected human speech is then separated as the header of the audio Doppler ultrasound within the developed GUI. An example of separated human voice and Doppler ultrasound is shown below.
