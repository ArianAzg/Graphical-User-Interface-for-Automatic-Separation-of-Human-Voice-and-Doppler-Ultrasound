# Graphical-User-Interface-for-Automatic-Separation-of-Human-Voice-and-Doppler-Ultrasound

In this repository, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to perform the automatic speech recognition and separation in audio Doppler recordings. In early 1970s and 1980s, audio Doppler recordings were captured in one-channel audio with the presence of human voice. The data remains undesired unless the human voice activity effectively gets separated from audio Doppler ultrasound.
